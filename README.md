# A Very Simple Restaurant Page

## What is this for?

This very basic page was created to help further my learning of how to use webpacks and ES6 modules for importing files into a main one. Creating this page helped me figure out how to use webpack to bundle everything together into one single javascript file while also teaching me how to create a page entirely out of Javascript as the only hard coded HTML element is the content div which is what everything is appended to via Javascript.
